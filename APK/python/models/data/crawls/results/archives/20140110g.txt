Choo's color pencil and acrylic-based large-scale paintings deceive the eye at first glance - they are drawn with an astonishing technique that renders the images extraordinarily photorealistic. This mid-career Korean artist's works are not only striking in its sheer size and process but also in what it depicts and represents. One of Choo's monochrome paintings realistically portrays men in presumably fine suits dining and wining in a festive and dynamic environment. However this scene is far from typical and familiar – from their torso and up the figures' chests and faces are disfigured as if they are made with paper crumbling and dissolving into the air. Choo claims his paintings reflect his perspective of the struggles of men today. He disassembles human bodies to represent the inner turmoil that people hide behind their façade of composure luxury and superficial joy. He writes "These empty and destroyed 'shells' represent the hypocrisy of men whose well-kept outer appearance belie deception corruption pretense and falsehood." Furthermore images of animals and children also frequently appear in his paintings but without the apparent scars that dominate his other adult-like figures. By juxtaposing the destroyed men with untouched children and animals the artist satirically critiques the contemporary men's loss of innocence and purity in today's highly materialistic and immoral society. In this way the artist successfully captures what he calls "the dehumanized soul". ,
