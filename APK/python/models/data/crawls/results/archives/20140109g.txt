Concurrence deals with multiplicity occurring simultaneously transcending the limits of space and time. Emerging artists create their individual art projects in the construction of their identities but at the same time are obliged to belong in the art world. They are necessitated to participate in exhibitions markets grants awards critiques and writings. Increased mobility real or virtual creates a palette for requisite collaborative projects as artists move together in shared experiences of a global society.,

The exhibit provides a glimpse of the artist's divergent concerns. Their shared experiences happen simultaneously coming together despite the differences in medium content location and ideals. Concerns in contemporary art institutional and otherwise are also reflected in the works. The artists while working together contemporaneously enhance and stimulate each other in their practice. The initiative in engaging complexities in art production provides a template for growth and development building towards a sustainable contemporary art world.,

Concurrence witnesses various narratives of cultures reflected and transformed by art. The projects range from personal social political historical and conceptual--yet each project comes together as a statement for contemporary Asian art. As an individual an artist may deal with specific concepts of dreams and ideals everyday lifestyle socio-political critiques and decay and decomposition; yet such individuality is transformed into a shared concern through multi-faceted connections. Individual art projects are transcribed into a unified goal formed together in a meeting of intentions. Concurrence prevails even as it is subservient to diverging goals and recalcitrant to various powers. ,
